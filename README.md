The dataset contains parasite infectivity, reproductive output, and virulence (i.e., the effects on host fecundity and lifespan), across a two-generational study to explore the effect of transgenerational plasticity in the fungal parasite Metschnikowia bicuspidata when infecting a crustacean zooplankton host Daphnia dentifera. This study was conducted in the Duffy Lab at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, in March 2022. We used parasite spores reared either at cooler (20째C) or warmer temperatures (24째C), to infect new hosts at 20째C or 24째C, with a fully factorial design. The data were analyzed using R version 4.1.2.
